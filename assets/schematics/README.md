# Schematics
All schematics are made in Fritzing and use their extension (.fzz). In Fritzing are three views available:
breadboard, schematic and PCB.


## firstsetup.fzz
setup with 2 breadboards and a floating Arduino. The stepper motors are connected to an easydriver which then are connected to an Arduino.
